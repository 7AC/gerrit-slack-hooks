# Common environment and configuration for Gerrit integration.
# dot-include this in your gerrit hook scripts, then use it like so:
#
#    echo "Oh wow, did you know this thing happened?" | SendMessage
#
# OR, customizing a bit:
#    echo "Oh wow, did you know this thing happened?" | CHANNEL='@mychannel' SendMessage
#

# The script requires a value for $WEBHOOK . You can provide it from the environment;
# or you may simply hardcode the value here:
# WEBHOOK=

#
# Site-specific customization goes here.
#
CHANNEL_DEFAULT='#eng'
FROM_DEFAULT='HamsterBot'

# To override a default value, set any of the following variables before calling SendMessage
# (though after including this env file):
CHANNEL=$CHANNEL_DEFAULT
FROM=$FROM_DEFAULT
